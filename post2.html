<h2> Let's Visit Attic Books!</h2>

                <p>This lovely book store is located on <i>240 Dundas St.</i> It has a wide range of genres. But <b>Attic Books</b> is slighly different from your everyday book store which would most likely carry best sellers, stationery and high fashion magazines. Just like the name suggests, it is a book store but with a more "attic like" prescence. Just like an attic they carry old, historic, used and donated pieces of literature! I for one was surprised at the variety! As you walk in there are books that greet you outside. Many customers stop here and browse before they enter.</p>

                <p>The interior is that of a library! Very clean and quiet on the day I went in at around noon. Every genre organized accordingly so ofcourse I arrived at the comic section first and chose three vintage Charlie Brown comic books to take home, <i>all for a total of $8 I might add!</i> 
                 I think what suprised me most was the wide range of antique books, of course, they <em>are</em> called 'Attic Books' but I was happy to see that even the old books my parents and grand-parents have such as the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew books were on the shelves.I think a lot of other people do and will experience this when they look around the store which I think is one of many reasons it's a very special place to visit.

                <p>The absolute must see part of the store is definately the <i>second level.</i> This is where they keep there more historical artifacts and books on art history. I even found old war letters located under a case with a picture of the queen non less! The upstairs also had comfortable places to sit and large windows that allowed you to see the busy street. It was clearly designed for a comfortable day with a good book which I can appreciate. What is even better is that if you choose to sit and read and find you are enjoying the book you can be rest assured you'll be able to afford it!
