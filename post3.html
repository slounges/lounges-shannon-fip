            <p>Right up the street from Attic Books at <i>186 Dundas St</i> is <b>Heroes Comics</b> which is probably my new favourite place on earth. Heroes Comics is a store that carries every collectors dreams. They have <i>old and new</i> toys and action figures, posters and almost every graphic novel and manga under the sun! As you walk in you are greeted by various trading items such as trading cards which are also up for sale and many figurines of well known tv show characters and a LOT of board games. The layout and decoration of the store is absolutely amazing especially the various piecies hanging from the cieling. The time and dedication taken to present the store with the little space and many items it has is remarkable!<p>

            <p>Just like Attic Books there is a second level in Heroes Comics. This is where most of their games are. Here I found very interesting interactive games <small>including one that had my name on it? I was so surpised!</small> But the best part about the second floor is the <i>view of the first level!</i> Here you have a closer look at the ceiling items and you can just about see just how MANY things they carry. <small>I feel bad for whoever is in charge of stock and inventory!</small><p>

            <p>Back on the first level I began looking for more collectibles. I really want to start a manga collection and it was very fun to find basically all of the animes I've watched here in manga form in the store! The graphic novels were all neatly places under their various genres so it was easy to look for specific titles. I ended up taking away a manga and some toploaders which all together was <i>about $15! </i>You gotta love that Canadian price. The staff was absolutely amazing they helped us find various items and didn't mind us taking photos of the merchandise which was greatly appreciated!<br><br> <a href="posts.html">go back</a> |
